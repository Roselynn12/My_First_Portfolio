    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a bag shop owner and a passionate learner, working on building my first website to offer free educational content.</p>

    <h3>Why I Started This Project</h3>
    <p>My goal is to empower learners by giving them access to free and simple learning materials, no matter where they are.</p>

    <p>With experience running an online business, I understand the value of strong visuals, clear layout, and accessible content.</p>

    <p>This site will grow with time â€” from HTML basics to full web applications for learners worldwide.</p>
